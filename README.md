# ðŸŽ® 20 Game Challenge

Welcome to my **20 Game Challenge**! The goal of this challenge is to design and develop 20 different games as a way to improve my game development skills, explore various genres and mechanics, and have fun in the process. You can find the link to the [**20 Games Challenge Website**](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io)

Each game will be listed below with a short description, tech stack used, and a link to the playable version or source code if available.

## âœ… Completed Games

### ðŸŽ® Game 1: Flappy Bird Clone
A simple clone of the classic Flappy Bird game. Tap or click to keep the bird in the air and avoid obstacles.
Taught me the basics of navigating the Godot Engine and using 2D nodes to create scenes, spaaning and deleting objects.
The game gets faster as you play and so becomes more difficult.
**Tech Stack**: Godot Engine  
**Status**: âœ… Complete  
**Play here**: *https://cl-frank.itch.io/20-g1-flappy-bird*

#### âœ¨ Possible Features to Add
